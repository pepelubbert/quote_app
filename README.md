# Getting Started with Quote App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It just gives you a nice quote in a smooth way. Nothing too complicated.
It changes color randomly with some constrains in order to make it look good, not too bright, with colors from oposite side from color loop from hsl()

Read those quotes and be inspired!
